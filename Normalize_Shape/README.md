## Point Detector
Neural network to detect certain keypoints on profile drawing. The detection network is based on the archticture developed by [Bin Xiao et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06208.pdf).
### Data Format
To train the network provide rgb images with corresponding keypoints. The keypoints should be dumped in [CVAT xml 1.1 format](https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/documentation/xml_format.md).
